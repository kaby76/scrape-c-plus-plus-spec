# scrape-c-plus-plus-spec
A program to scrape the grammar from Annex A of one of the ISO148822 specs

A copy of the draft of the 2014 spec from http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/
([originally here](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4296.pdf))
is place in this repo. The [copy in this repo](https://github.com/kaby76/scrape-c-plus-plus-spec/blob/main/c-plus-plus-spec-draft.pdf)
is a re-OCR'ed PDF. The original copy contained several OCR'ed characters that
the scraper had problems with.
